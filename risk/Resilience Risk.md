## Resilience Risk: Definition, Key Components, Impact, Mitigation Strategies, Regulatory Focus, and Example from Banking Perspective

**Resilience Risk** refers to the potential inability of an organization, particularly in the banking sector, to effectively respond to and recover from disruptive events. This encompasses risks associated with operational disruptions that could impact the delivery of critical services and overall organizational stability. Resilience risk highlights the importance of not only managing risks but also ensuring that an organization can withstand and adapt to unforeseen challenges.

### Key Components

1. **Operational Resilience:** The ability of a bank to maintain critical operations during and after a disruption. This includes systems, processes, and people working together effectively.

2. **Business Continuity Planning:** Strategies and plans that ensure essential functions can continue during a crisis, including disaster recovery protocols.

3. **Incident Management:** Processes for identifying, responding to, and recovering from incidents that could disrupt operations.

4. **Risk Appetite and Tolerance:** The level of risk an organization is willing to accept regarding operational disruptions and its capacity to manage such risks.

### Impact

- **Financial Losses:** Disruptions can lead to significant financial costs due to downtime or loss of business opportunities.

- **Reputational Damage:** Inability to respond effectively to crises can harm customer trust and brand reputation.

- **Regulatory Consequences:** Failure to meet resilience requirements may result in penalties or increased scrutiny from regulators.

- **Operational Failures:** Critical functions may be compromised, leading to service interruptions that affect customers and stakeholders.

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Strengthening Internal Controls:** Implementing robust systems and processes that enhance operational resilience against disruptions.

- **Regular Testing and Drills:** Conducting simulations and stress tests to evaluate the effectiveness of business continuity plans and incident management procedures.

- **Investment in Technology:** Upgrading IT infrastructure to ensure systems are resilient against cyber threats and other technological disruptions.

- **Vendor Risk Management:** Assessing third-party relationships to ensure they have adequate resilience measures in place, reducing dependency on vulnerable suppliers.

### Regulatory Focus

Regulatory bodies have increasingly emphasized the importance of operational resilience in banking:

- The **Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)** has integrated operational resilience into its supervisory framework, requiring banks to develop comprehensive strategies that ensure critical operations can continue during disruptions.

- Regulations such as the **EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)** focus on enhancing the resilience of financial institutions against digital threats, mandating robust risk management practices.

- Supervisory expectations now include not just compliance with capital requirements but also the ability of banks to manage operational risks effectively and maintain service continuity under various scenarios.

### Example from Banking Perspective

A notable example of resilience risk in banking is the case of a bank experiencing a significant cyberattack. If the bank has inadequate incident management protocols, it may struggle to maintain critical operations during the attack. For instance, if customer transactions are disrupted due to system outages caused by the attack, it could lead to financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties for failing to protect customer data adequately. 

In contrast, a bank with strong operational resilience would have pre-established incident response plans that allow it to quickly recover from such disruptions while continuing essential services, thus minimizing impact on customers and maintaining regulatory compliance. 

In summary, resilience risk encompasses the challenges banks face in maintaining operational integrity during disruptive events. By focusing on robust mitigation strategies and adhering to regulatory expectations, banks can enhance their resilience against various risks.

Answer from Perplexity: pplx.ai/share

Cyberattacks Sophisticated cyberattacks can disrupt critical banking functions and services, such as providing credit or processing payments, potentially damaging trust in the banking system13. The number of cyber incidents reported to the ECB nearly doubled from 2022 to 2023, with attacks increasing in sophistication1.

IT and system failures An inability to access documents and systems due to failures can significantly impair a bank's operations. The example of Amsterdam Trade Bank (ATB), which faced denied access to critical documents for credit officers, demonstrates how a lack of robust contingency planning for operational shocks can lead to major issues, even bankruptcy, despite having sufficient capital and liquidity1.

Operational resilience, from a bank's perspective, is the ability to deliver critical operations through disruption. This encompasses identifying and protecting against threats and potential failures, as well as responding to, adapting to, recovering from, and learning from disruptive events in order to minimize their impact[1][3]. A key component of operational resilience is a bank's tolerance for disruption, which is the level of disruption a bank is willing to accept from any type of operational risk, considering a range of severe but plausible scenarios[1][3].

**Impact of Resilience Risk**
Untimely lapses in operations and losses from disruptions can be lessened in an operationally resilient bank, which reduces the impact of incidents on essential operations, services, functions, and systems[1].

**Mitigation Strategies**
To strengthen operational resilience across the bank, banks should coordinate their business continuity planning, third-party dependency management, recovery and resolution planning, and other relevant risk management frameworks[1]. Key strategies include:
*   **Governance** The board of directors should review and approve the bank’s operational resilience approach, considering the bank’s risk appetite and tolerance for disruption to its critical operations[1]. Senior management should implement the bank’s operational resilience approach and ensure that financial, technical, and other resources are appropriately allocated[1].
*   **Operational Risk Management** Banks should have sufficient controls and procedures to identify and assess threats and vulnerabilities in a timely manner and, to the extent possible, prevent them from affecting critical operations delivery[1].
*   **Business Continuity Planning and Testing** Banks should coordinate their business continuity planning, third-party dependency management, recovery and resolution planning, and other relevant risk management frameworks to strengthen operational resilience across the bank[1].
*   **Mapping Interconnections and Interdependencies** Banks should map the people, technology, processes, information, facilities, and the interconnections and interdependencies among them as needed to deliver the bank’s critical operations, including those dependent upon third parties or intragroup arrangements[1].

**Regulatory Focus**
Regulators are concerned about the financial resilience of banks[2]. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has defined operational resilience and provided principles for it, emphasizing the need for banks to manage operational risk effectively[1]. Banks are required to implement changes by January 25, 2024, to ensure a seamless transition toward operational resiliency[5].

**Examples of Resilience Risk**
While the search results do not provide explicit examples of resilience risk, they do refer to risks such as a pandemic, and the possibility of failures in internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events[1][4].

Answer from Perplexity: pplx.ai/share

Based on the search results, here are four examples of resilience risk for banks:

1.  **Cyberattacks** Sophisticated cyberattacks can disrupt critical banking functions and services, such as providing credit or processing payments, potentially damaging trust in the banking system[1][3]. The number of cyber incidents reported to the ECB nearly doubled from 2022 to 2023, with attacks increasing in sophistication[1].
2.  **IT and system failures** An inability to access documents and systems due to failures can significantly impair a bank's operations. The example of Amsterdam Trade Bank (ATB), which faced denied access to critical documents for credit officers, demonstrates how a lack of robust contingency planning for operational shocks can lead to major issues, even bankruptcy, despite having sufficient capital and liquidity[1].
3.  **Third-party dependency** Banks' increasing reliance on interconnected functions, operations, and third-party providers increases the risk of service incidents[3]. A concentration risk may arise from relying on a select group of providers[3].
4.  **Climate-related risks** Banks face commercial pressures due to the impact of climate change and must align with the global sustainability agenda[3]. Banks are taking steps to integrate climate and environmental (C&E) risks into their strategy, governance, and risk management[5].

Third-party dependency Banks' increasing reliance on interconnected functions, operations, and third-party providers increases the risk of service incidents3. A concentration risk may arise from relying on a select group of providers3.

Climate-related risks Banks face commercial pressures due to the impact of climate change and must align with the global sustainability agenda3. Banks are taking steps to integrate climate and environmental (C&E) risks into their strategy, governance, and risk management5.
