Here’s a short slide deck outline you can use based on the insights:

Slide 1: Title Slide

Title:
RWA Segmentation Insights and Strategic Actions

Subtitle:
Customer, RWA, Revenue, and Profitability Analysis


---

Slide 2: Customer Distribution

73% of customers are in Very Low segment.

19% in Low, 6% in Medium, 2% in High, and only 0.3% in Very High.

Insight:
Large customer base concentrated in low-risk, high-return segments.



---

Slide 3: RWA (Risk-Weighted Assets) Distribution

82% of total RWA is concentrated in High and Very High segments.

Very few customers carry the majority of risk.

Insight:
Need strong risk management focus on a small set of clients.



---

Slide 4: Revenue Distribution

Low (37%) and Medium (23%) segments generate 60% of revenue.

Very High segment, despite large RWA, generates only 8% revenue.

Insight:
Revenue not aligned with risk exposure in upper segments.



---

Slide 5: Profitability and RoTE

Very Low and Low segments have excellent RoTE (69% and 54%).

Medium, High, and Very High segments show very low returns (1%-8%).

Negative customers are loss-making (-69% RoTE).

Insight:
Focus on improving or exiting low-return, high-risk relationships.



---

Slide 6: Strategic Recommendations

Prioritize growth in Very Low and Low segments.

Review pricing, risk, and profitability strategies for High and Very High segments.

Exit or restructure relationships with Negative RoTE customers.

Cross-sell or upsell to the Medium segment to boost profitability.



---

Slide 7: Conclusion

Key Challenge:
Balancing revenue generation with risk-adjusted returns.

Next Steps:
Deep dive analysis per customer; adjust pricing, cost, or exit strategies.

Thanks for clarifying that RWA means Risk-Weighted Assets — that's important!

Given this, here’s a more accurate analysis and insights based on your Revenue Segmentation table and charts:

Updated Insights

1. Customer Segments Summary


---

2. Key Observations

High Revenue customers (14% of customers) are heavily dominant, holding 74% of total revenue and 87% of the risk-weighted assets (RWA).

ROA is strong at 4.4%, showing efficient use of risk-weighted capital.


Medium Revenue customers are 44% of customers but bring only 25% of revenue and 9% of RWA.

ROA is lower at 1.4%, meaning they are less efficient compared to High Revenue customers.


Low Revenue and Negative customers (combined 42% of customers) account for less than 5% of RWA, but the Negative customers actually cause losses.



---

3. Risk-Return Analysis

High Revenue segment is riskier (holding 87% of RWA) but also most profitable.

Negative segment consumes 4% of RWA but generates losses, deteriorating overall capital efficiency.

Medium segment is less risky but moderately profitable; potential to grow and upgrade into High Revenue with focused investment.



---

Strategic Recommendations

1. Protect and Expand High Revenue Customers:

Prioritize relationship management, cross-selling, and retention.

Focus on credit quality to manage high RWA concentration risk.



2. Transform Medium Revenue Customers:

Identify high-potential Medium customers and nurture them into High Revenue.

Offer customized solutions or incentives to grow their wallet share.



3. Review Negative Customers:

Assess whether they can be turned profitable through restructuring or cost optimization.

Otherwise, consider exiting or re-pricing relationships to reduce drag on ROA.



4. Manage RWA Efficiency:

Explore techniques to optimize RWA through better risk management (e.g., collateral, guarantees, better credit scoring).



5. Diversify:

Since a small group of customers (14%) carries most of the revenue and risk, look to diversify customer base to reduce concentration risk.





---

Conclusion

The company is reliant on a few big customers, who are efficiently generating returns despite high risk-weighted exposure. However, there is a vulnerability to shocks if any of these customers default or leave. Managing this concentration carefully and developing the Medium segment will strengthen resilience.

Would you like me to also create a visual summary (like a strategic dashboard or SWOT) based on these insights? It could help if you're presenting this to stakeholders.
