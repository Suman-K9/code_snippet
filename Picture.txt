who said use a picture is worth thousand words ?
There’s some debate around the exact origin of the saying “A picture is worth a thousand words.” Here’s what we know:

Attributed Quote: The most popular attribution is to Fred R. Barnard, an American advertising executive. In 1921, he used the phrase “One Look Is Worth A Thousand Words” in an advertisement for his agency. Later, he switched it to “Chinese Proverb: One Picture Is Worth Ten Thousand Words” with some Chinese characters for increased credibility, but the proverb itself wasn’t traced back to any verifiable Chinese source.

Earlier Usages: There are earlier instances of similar phrases found in print:

March 1911: Newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane said “Use a picture. It’s worth a thousand words” in a speech to advertising men.
1913: A similar phrase appeared in a newspaper advertisement.
So, while Fred R. Barnard is most often credited with popularizing the saying, it likely evolved from earlier expressions about the power of visuals.
